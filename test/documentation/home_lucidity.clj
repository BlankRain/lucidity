"# Welcome

### What is It?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) is a set of libraries that assist in making clojure's already awesome **in-repl** development experience even more awesome. It provides:

- a rich set of functions to enable better reasoning about the code.
- tools for managing both the source and tests.
- tools for publishing documentation for the library.

### Why was it made?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) has been steadily built around the workflow of it's [author](https://github.com/zcaudate) to automate repetitive tasks when coding. It is the merging of three libraries: [lein-midje-doc](https://github.com/zcaudate/lein-midje-doc), [vinyasa](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity/tree/vinyasaa) and [jai](https://github.com/zcaudate/jai) and is used extensively in the management of quality assurance, deployment and publication of the [hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara) suite of libraries.

### Okay, lets go!

List of current libraries:

- [lucid.core](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-core.html) - functions for the code environment
- [lucid.mind](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-mind.html) - contemplative reflection for the jvm
- [lucid.publish](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-publish.html) - generate documentation from code
- [lucid.space](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-space.html) - management of project externals
- [lucid.unit](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-unit.html) - metadata through unit tests
