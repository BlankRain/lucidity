### What is It?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) is a set of libraries that assist in making the already awesome in-repl development experience even more awesome. It provides:

- a rich set of functions to enable better reasoning about the code.
- tools for managing both the source and tests.
- tools for publishing documentation for the library.

### Why was it made?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) has been steadily built around the workflow of it's main [author](https://github.com/zcaudate) to automate repetitive tasks when coding.


### Okay, lets go!
