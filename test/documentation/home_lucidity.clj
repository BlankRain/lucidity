"# Welcome

### What is It?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) is a set of libraries that assist in making clojure's already awesome **in-repl** development experience even more awesome. It provides:

- a rich set of functions to enable better reasoning about the code.
- tools for managing both the source and tests.
- tools for publishing documentation for the library.

### Why was it made?

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) has been steadily built around the automation of repetitive coding tasks. It merges the five following libraries into a single codebase: 

- [jai](https://github.com/zcaudate/jai)
- [lein-midje-doc](https://github.com/zcaudate/lein-midje-doc)
- [lein-repack](https://github.com/zcaudate/lein-repack)
- [vinyasa](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity/tree/vinyasa)
- [wu.kong](https://github.com/zcaudate/wu.kong) 

[lucidity](https://github.com/zcaudate/lucidity) is used extensively in the management of quality assurance, deployment and publication of it's own codebase as well as the codebase of [hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara).

### Okay, lets go!

List of current libraries:

- [lucid.aether](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-aether.html) - wrapper for `org.eclipse.aether`
- [lucid.core](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-core.html) - functions for the code environment
- [lucid.distribute](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-distribute.html) - code repackaging and distribution
- [lucid.mind](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-mind.html) - contemplative reflection for the jvm
- [lucid.package](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-package.html) - project packaging and dependencies
- [lucid.publish](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-publish.html) - generate documentation from code
- [lucid.unit](http://docs.caudate.me/lucidity/lucid-unit.html) - metadata through unit tests
